## Assignment 3-

        Write a computer program for finding eigenvalues of a matrix A. The user should
        have the option of selecting one of the following methods–
        
            a. Direct power method (to find the eigenvalue having the maximum magnitude and the
            corresponding eigenvector)
            b. Inverse power method (to find the eigenvalue having the minimum magnitude and the
            corresponding eigenvector)
            c. Shifted-power method (to find intermediate eigenvalues [based on Gershgorin disc]
            and corresponding eigenvectors)
            d. QR method (to find all eigenvalues of a matrix; write your own program for GramSchmidt process)
